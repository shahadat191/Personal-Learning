    <b>Care About Your Craft</b> - We feel that there is no point in developing software unless you care about doing it well.</h5>
  </li>
  <li> <b> Think! About Your Work </b> - Write code that’s easier to maintain, and spend less time in meetings.</li>

<h2> It's a continuous processs </h2>
<p>Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire. Unlike the Eton lawns, you’ll start seeing results in a matter of days. Over the years, you’ll be amazed at how your experience has blossomed and your skills have grown.</p>

<h1> A Pragmatic Philosophy </h1>
<p>
  Pragmatic programmers think beyond the immediate problem, always trying to place it in its larger context, always trying to be aware of the bigger picture. After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic? How can you make intelligent compromises and informed decisions?
</p>
  
<p>
Another key to their success is that they take responsibility for every- thing they do.
</p>

<h2> The Cat Ate My Source Code </h2>
<p>One of the cornerstones of the pragmatic philosophy is the idea of taking responsibility for yourself and your actions in terms of your career advancement, your project, and your day-to-day work.</p>
<p>
 We can be proud of our abilities, but we must be honest about our shortcomings our ignorance as well as our mistakes.
</p>

<h3> Take Responsibility </h3>
<p>
  When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.
 </p>
 <p>
  Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don’t blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.
 </p>
 <p>
  If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn’t come through for you, then you should have had a contingency plan.

  <p> <kbd> <b>Tips 3: Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses.</b> </kbd></p>
  
<p> Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can’t be done, is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How’s it going to sound to your boss?
</p>
</p>
Run through the conversation in your mind. What is the other person likely to say? Will they ask, “Have you tried this       ” or “Didn’t you con- sider that?” How will you respond? Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try? Sometimes, you just know what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.
</p>

</p>
Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation. Does code have to be thrown out? Educate them on the value of refactoring (see Refactoring, page 184). Do you need to spend time prototyping to determine the best way to proceed (see Prototypes and Post-it Notes, page 53)? Do you need to introduce better testing (see Code That’s Easy to Test, page 189, and Ruthless Testing, page 237) or automation (see Ubiquitous Automation, page 230) to prevent it from happening again? Perhaps you need ad- ditional resources. Don’t be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help.
